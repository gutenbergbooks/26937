<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>This syllabus, or finding-list, is offered to lovers of folk-literature
in the hope that it may not be without interest and value to them for
purposes of comparison and identification. It includes 333 items,
exclusive of 114 variants, and embraces all popular songs that have so
far come to hand as having been "learned by ear instead of by eye," as
existing through oral transmission&mdash;song-ballads, love-songs,
number-songs, dance-songs, play-songs, child-songs, counting-out rimes,
lullabies, jigs, nonsense rimes, ditties, etc.</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe that many more such await the
collector; in fact, their number is constantly being increased even
today by the creation of new ones, by adaptation of the old, and even by
the
<a name="corr1" id="corr1"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn1" title="changed from 'absorbtion'">absorption</a>
and consequent metamorphosis, of literary,
quasi-literary, or pseudo-literary types into the current of oral
tradition.</p>

<p>This collection, then, is by no means complete: means have not been
available for a systematic and scientific search for these folk-songs,
which have been gathered very casually during the past five years
through occasional travel, acquaintanceship, and correspondence in only
the twenty-one following counties: Fayette, Madison, Rowan, Elliott,
Carter, Boyd, Lawrence, Morgan, Johnson, Pike, Knott, Breathitt, Clay,
Laurel, Rockcastle, Garrard, Boyle, Anderson, Shelby, Henry, and
Owen&mdash;all lying in Central and Eastern Kentucky.</p>

<p>All of the material listed has thus been collected in this State, though
a variant of The Jew's Daughter, page <a href='#Page_8'>8</a>, has come by chance from
Michigan, and another of The Pretty Mohee, page <a href='#Page_12'>12</a>, was sent from
Georgia. The Cumberland Mountain region, in the eastern part of the
State, has naturally furnished the larger half of the material, because
of local conditions favorable to the propagation of folk-song. However,
sections of Kentucky lying farther to the westward are almost equally
prolific. The wide extension of the same ballad throughout the State
argues convincingly for the unity of the Kentucky stock&mdash;a fact which
may be confirmed in more ways than one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>The arrangement is as follows: The material in hand is loosely grouped
in eighteen sections, according to origin, chronology, content, or form.
Though logically at fault, because of the cross-division thus inevitably
entailed, this plan has seemed to be the best. No real confusion will
result to the user in consequence. In fact, no matter what system be
adopted, certain songs will belong equally well to two or more different
categories.</p>

<p>Under each of these eighteen main divisions the treatment of the
individual song-ballad is in general as follows: First, stands the
title, with variant titles in parentheses. Should this be unknown, a
caption coined by the editors is placed in brackets. Secondly, a Roman
numeral immediately follows the above to denote the number of versions,
if variants have been found. Thirdly, the prosodical character of the
song is roughly indicated by a combination of letters and numerals. Each
letter indicates a line; the variation in the letters indicates, in the
usual fashion, the rime-scheme of the stanza. Each numeral indicates the
number of stresses in the line (or lines) denoted by the letter (or
letters) immediately succeeding it. When a chorus, burden, or refrain is
present, the metrical scheme of this stands immediately after an "and,"
as, for example, in The Blue and the Gray, page <a href='#Page_14'>14</a>. In the case of the
refrain, the letters used are independent of those immediately preceding
the "and," and denoting the rime-scheme of the stanza proper. Fourthly,
an Arabic numeral follows to indicate the number of stanzas in the song,
exclusive of the refrain, should one be present. If the number of
stanzas in a ballad is indeterminable, because its form is fragmentary,
or because its variant versions differ in length, this fact is indicated
by an appended ca (<i>circa</i>). Sixth, and last, is a synopsis, or other
attempt to give briefly such data as may serve to complete the
identification.</p>

<p>Illustration of the third item above may be helpful. Thus in Pretty
Polly, on page <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>, 4aabb indicates a quatrain riming in couplets, with
four stresses in each line. In Jackaro, page <a href='#Page_9'>9</a>, 3abcb indicates a
quatrain riming alternately, with three stressed syllables in each line.
In The King's Daughter, page <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>, 4a3b4c3b indicates a quatrain, with only
the second and fourth lines riming and with four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> stresses in the first
and third lines and three stresses in the second and fourth. In Johnnie
Came from Sea, page <a href='#Page_14'>14</a>, 6aa denotes a rimed couplet, with six stresses
in each line.</p>

<p>It has, naturally, been difficult at times to decide whether certain
stanzas should be counted as couplets, or as quatrains half as long. In
such cases, the air, or tune, and other data, often rather subtle, have
been employed in making
<a name="corr2" id="corr2"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn2" title="changed from 'decision'">decisions</a>.
The quatrain form has in uncertain
instances been given the benefit of the doubt. Even thus, certain minor
inconsistencies will perhaps be noted. It is hardly necessary to add
that assonance freely occurs in the place of rime, and as such it is
considered throughout.</p>

<p>All attempt to indicate the prevailing metrical unit, or foot, within
the line has been frankly given over. Iambs, dactyls, and their ilk
receive scant courtesy from the composer of folk-song, who without qualm
or quaver will stretch one syllable, or even an utter silence (caesura),
into the time of a complete bar; while in the next breath he will with
equal equanimity huddle a dozen syllables into the same period.
Consequently, this item, even if it could be indicated, would have scant
descriptive value.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant duty to acknowledge gratefully the assistance of those
who have transmitted to our hands many of the songs: Mesdames J. W.
Combs, W. T. Phillips, Jennie L. Combs, Richard Smith, Martha Smith,
Ruth Hackney, W. F. Hays, Ollie Huff, Robin Cornett, Lucy Banks, Sarah
Burton, Kittie Jordan, and Ruby Martin; Misses Martha Jent, Maud Dean,
Virginia Jordan, Jessie Green, Lizzie Cody, Margaret Combs, Barbara
Smith, Helena E. Rose, Sarah Burton, Sarah Hillman, Cordia Bramblett,
Nannie S. Graham, Myrtle Wheeler, Melissa Holbrook, Rosetta Wheeler,
Ruth Hackney, Ora McDavid, Jeannette McDavid; Messrs. Wm. W. Berry,
Chas. Hackney, S. B. Wheeler, R. L. Morgan, Enoch Wheeler, Thos. H.
Hackney, James Goodman, W. S. Wheeler, Harry M. Morgan, Henry Lester, T.
G. Wheeler, C. F. Bishop, and John C. Jones.</p>

<p>Especially helpful as collaborators have been Messrs. Winfred Cox, Emory
E. Wheeler, Roud Shaw, A. B. Johnston, C. E. Phillips, and H.
Williamson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Kind words or letters of appreciation and, in some cases, of suggestion,
from the following have encouraged the preparation of this syllabus:
Professors Alexander S. Mackenzie, of the Kentucky State University;
Clarence C. Freeman, of Transylvania University; John A. Lomax, of the
University of Texas; Albert H. Tolman, of the University of Chicago;
John M. McBride, Jr., of the University of the South; George Lyman
Kittredge, of Harvard University; Henry M. Belden, of the University of
Missouri; and Katherine Jackson, formerly of Bryn Mawr College, who has
most generously given the use of her manuscript collection. None of the
shortcomings of this brochure, however, can be imputed to them in the
slightest degree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
